# about

**_slick_** is a tool to calculate CO, [CI] and [CII] line intensities from large datasets of clouds/galaxies in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. It runs radiative transfer equations on each gas particle of the simulation, and outputs a table with all clouds' and galaxies' luminosities for all redshifts of interest.

The version of the algorithm you'll find here was designed for the [SIMBA](http://simba.roe.ac.uk/) simulation datasets. Its application to IllustrisTNG is coming soon.
